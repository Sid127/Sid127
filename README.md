### So you have stumbled upon my humble profile ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on Custom ROMs for Nokia 6.1 Plus (DRG_sprout)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been working on Ubuntu Touch for [Nokia SDM660](https://github.com/ubports-nokia-sdm660) devices, though I'm focusing more on android stuff at the moment
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in my first year of uni and looking forward to becoming an Astrophysicist
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding more time in my day :P
